In **Bubble Sort**, the main idea is to repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a high-level idea of the operations involved in Bubble Sort:

1. Comparing Adjacent Elements: Iterate through the array and compare adjacent elements.
2. Swapping Elements: If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
3. Moving through the Array: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each pair of adjacent elements in the array.
4. Iteration: After completing one pass through the array, the largest unsorted element will "bubble up" to its correct position at the end of the array.
5. Repeat: Repeat steps 1-4 for each element until the entire array is sorted.
6. Termination: The algorithm terminates when no more swaps are needed during a pass through the array, indicating that the array is sorted.

This process continues until the array is sorted, with each pass through the array resulting in at least one element being placed in its correct position. 
Eventually, after enough passes, the entire array becomes sorted.
